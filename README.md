# Agriculture-Information-System

Our Aim:

The aim of the web based project "Agriculture Information System" is to create awareness among the farmers by educating them by conducting the camps which are managed by the representatives of the village, who are a part of the web application, and can access the various resources and details uploaded by the agricultural professionals. Using this application will be advantageous to the farmers because it will encourage them to use new technologies which will ultimately lead to efficiency in their work as well as their earning.
